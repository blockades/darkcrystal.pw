## Setting up locally

- need data for the following which are gitignored by default
  `/content`
  `/site/accounts`

This is done so that all content is managed on the server. To get the most up to date content one would need to grab the data from the server.

If you need the content then ask Dan who will likely store example data on the team private keybase filesystem.
