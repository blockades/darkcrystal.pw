Title: Dark Crystal

----

Intro: 

<small>What is Dark Crystal?</small>

Dark Crystal transforms secrets into crystal shards that you can send <img class="gif" src="assets/images/ssb-gifs/hermes-computer-typing-small.gif" /> to trusted friends. If you lose the secret, or something happens to you, your friends can combine the shards to recover <img class="gif2" src="assets/images/ssb-gifs/hermes-claw-mouth-kiss.gif" /> the crystal and reveal the secret.

Dark Crystal uses cryptography so that no individual shard reveals anything about your secret on its own. Your secret is only revealed if the people you chose cooperate<img class="gif" src="assets/images/ssb-gifs/hermes-small-butt-dance.gif" /> and put their shards together.

<div class="notes"> 1. Until modern times, cryptography referred almost exclusively to encryption, which is the process of converting ordinary information (called plaintext) into unintelligible text (called ciphertext). Decryption is the reverse, in other words, moving from the unintelligible ciphertext back to plaintext. A cipher (or cypher) is a pair of algorithms that create the encryption and the reversing decryption.</div>
