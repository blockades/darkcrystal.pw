http://localhost/darkcrystal.pw/darkcrystal/

- port darkcrystal.pw to kirby
	- new branch `kirby`
	- have moved darkcrystal (fresh kirby install) inside project
		- figure out how to handle content.
	- need to think about where ssb protocol docs live
	- need to think about where old content lives within new structure
	- need to tidy boilerplate kirby stuff and strip it back
	- aim is to make it look like it currently does but to be `kirby`-ised
