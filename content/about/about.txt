Title: About

Intro: The Magic Money Tree project started when Dan Hassan gifted 50 people cryptocurrency who otherwise would not have gotten involved in it, and used these experiences as research into what it actually takes to make cryptocurrency accessible to more diverse people. Over the last year, we have zeroed in on safe management of private keys as a foundational problem to solve. Dan Hassan then brought a team together with a track record of delivering new socio-technological open source tools and we got to work.
